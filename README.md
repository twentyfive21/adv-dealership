# Interesting piece of code :![Screenshot 2024-05-14 at 10 22 52 PM](https://github.com/twentyfive21/adv-dealership/assets/107441301/60fe646b-f3e4-4aea-a3dc-9240f3c18495)

## I found this piece of code interesting because when I finished writing my sales contract code I realized that I would have to repeat the exact same thing for lease. That would be just as long and sales was already alot of code. I knew that would violate the DRY code principle and knew I could make this a utility method. By making this a util method I can use it for both contracts now and am happy with the implementation!
